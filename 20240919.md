corpus:
- years 2013-2019
- 104 papers

corpus themes:
- course design factors
  - Effective in improving achievement and satisfaction
    - feedback from instructor
    - incorporation of multiple pedagogies and learning resources
    - feedback from peers
    - user-friendly online tools
    - high instructor presence
    - promotion of socialization
    - group cohesion
    - trust 
    - face-to-face teaching (compared to online or hybrid)
  - Less effectivene:
    - groupwork
    - online lectures
- student support
  - important to student achievement in online coursework:
    - orientation to online instruction prior to beginning coursework
    - quality of faculty-student interaction
    - academic support for students
    - establishment of trust
    - a sense of community
- faculty pedagogy
  - a positive relationship between the number of student posts and course learning
  - social media facilitated student-to-student interaction
  - synchronous environments encourages active learning
  - synchronous environments requires greater student motivation
  - synchronous environments requires greater proficiency with the technology
  - faculty feedback is more important to students than peer feedback, and timeliness and usefulness are qualities of effective feedback. 
  - Given the student perception that feedback can feel threatening, findings from a few studies indicate that perception of instructor presence can mitigate these feelings and improve student motivation.
  - metacognitive support improves student higher level thinking
  - selection of learning partners in group activities is a factor in student success.
  - mixed results whether the number and quality of instructor posts are related to student participation on discussion forums and course achievement
  - mixed effectiveness from interventions designed to increase student participation in discussion forums â€“ such as incorporation of orientation sessions, visual materials, and social media venues 
  - no significant correlations between viewing videos as preparation for in-class sessions and tests and learning outcomes
  - social media does not facilitate academic learning
  - viewing videos as preparation for in-class sessions and tests has no effect on course achievement
  - students are inconsistent in accessing videos
- student engagement
  - greater interaction with online course content is related to better course grades and satisfaction
  - peer and instructor interaction are not consistently related to course satisfaction
- student success factors
  - no correlations were found between student learning style and online course achievement
  - personal self-efficacy and Internet self-efficacy predict online academic achievemen
  - online course achievement is increased by past academic success, motivation, family support, workload management, and digital literacy

Effective face-to-face teaching:
- the use of multiple pedagogies and learning resources to address different student learning needs
- high instructor presence
- quality of faculty-student interaction
- academic support outside of class
- promotion of classroom cohesion
- trust

Effective online teaching:
- Same as effective face-to-face teaching
- user-friendly technology tools
- orientation to online instruction
- opportunities for synchronous class sessions
- incorporation of social media

Evidence-based effective:
- only faculty feedback
