First sentence already is deceptive: 'Body language is an important aspect in
educational settings, directly influencing
educators’ effectiveness in message delivery, classroom management, and student
interactions (Benzer, 2012).'. This references a paper called
'Teachers’ Opinions about the Use of Body Language', where
that ask 100 teachers
if they think body language is important.
'When asked, teachers think body language is an important aspect in
educational settings, with possible effects on influencing
educators’ effectiveness in message delivery, classroom management, and student
interactions'.
