## FAQ

### How do I know when meetings are?

The schedule above shows when the meetings are :-)

### How do I know which paper or book chapter will be discussed?

Papers will be scheduled ahead of time, 
ideally at least one month in advance.

### Why is there no emaillist?

Because no need for it is felt yet.
You are encouraged to volunteer to maintain one :-)

### How does a meeting go?

When you show up at a meeting,
someone has prepared to discuss a paper or book chapter.
This paper or book chapter is announced on this website,
ideally at least one month in advance.

The person having picked the reading material determines freely:

- whether there is a presentation about the reading material 
- how to lead a discussion on the reading material

### I am not part of NBIS. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to attend and will be 5 minutes late. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to attend without having read the paper. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to attend without suggesting to read a paper. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to discuss a paper or book chapter. How do I do so?

Great!

**First**, we need to know, so we can put you in the schedule and share
the reading materials one meeting in advance with the rest.

To let us know: create an Issue here or send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`.

**Second**, on the day you discuss a paper or book chapter,
you may determine freely:

- whether there is a presentation about the reading material 
- how to lead a discussion on the reading material

The meeting will end sharply on time!

### I present a paper or book chapter and need to cancel at the last minute. What do I do?

Create an Issue here or send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`.
Elin and Richel will always have a paper to be discussed ready.

### Why online-only?

NBIS is a national organisation throughout Sweden, 
hence online is the norm.

### Why not hybrid?

We felt it was reasonable to start online-only first.
Hybrid meetings are more complex, 
but we can imagine we go hybrid one day,
when groups in different cities start gathering.

### Why not meet in real life?

NBIS is a national organisation throughout Sweden,
so meeting in real life (in any one place) would exclude most of NBIS.

### Why monthly?

We felt this is a reasonable starting frequency. 
If the schedule starts overflowing, 
we will consider doing this every two weeks.

### Why not organise this differently?

Because this is the current plan. 

You can share your feedback at this repository by:
 
- creating an [Issue](https://github.com/NBISweden/teaching_literature_club/issues):
  this results in a public discussion and require a GitHub account
- sending an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`
- share your feedback in the next round:
  a round of collection of feedback is planned in November,
  i.e. after the third meeting. 
  These results will probably be shared in December, 
  i.e. during the fourth meeting.
