## FAQ

### How does a meeting go?

When you show up at a meeting,
someone has prepared to discuss a paper or book chapter.

That person determines freely:

- whether there is a presentation about the reading material 
- how to lead a discussion on the reading material

### I am not part of NBIS. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to attend and will be 5 minutes late. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to attend without having read the paper. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to attend without suggesting to read a paper. Am I welcome?

Yes.

### I want to discuss a paper or book chapter. How do I do so?

Great!

**First**, we need to know, so we can put you in the schedule and share
the reading materials one meeting in advance with the rest.

To let us know: create an Issue here or send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`.

**Second**, on the day you discuss a paper or book chapter,
you may determine freely:

- whether there is a presentation about the reading material 
- how to lead a discussion on the reading material

The meeting will end sharply on time!

### I present a paper or book chapter and need to cancel at the last minute. What do I do?

Create an Issue here or send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`.
Elin and Richel will always have a paper to be discussed ready.

### Why online-only?

NBIS is a national organisation throughout Sweden, 
hence online is the norm.https://github.com/NBISweden/teaching_literature_club

### Why not hybrid?

We felt it was reasonable to start online-only first.
Hybrid meetings are more complex, 
but we can imagine we go hybrid one day,
when groups in different cities start gathering.

### Why not meet in real life?

NBIS is a national organisation throughout Sweden,
so meeting in real life (in any one place) would exclude most of NBIS.

### Why monthly?

We felt this is a reasonable starting frequency. 
If the schedule starts overflowing, 
we will consider doing this every two weeks.
