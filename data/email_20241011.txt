Dear corresponding author of 'Evaluating the impact of an automated body language assessment system' with https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-12931-5,

At a literature for club we are discussing your paper. For that, having the data would help our discussions. Could you please share it?

Thanks and cheers, Richel Bilderbeek
