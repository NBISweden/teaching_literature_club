Dear colleague,

We will be discussing your paper 'The paradox of seduction by irrelevant details: How irrelevant
information helps and hinders self-regulated learning' at a literature club and it would be insightful to get access to (part of) the raw data and/or computer code. Is this possible? If yes, how to obtain it?

Thanks and cheers, Richel Bilderbeek, postdoc
