The paper claims that SET is useless,
as the factors that most influence the grade are not about teacher
quality.

- p = p value
- p with a flat hat = correlation


Data is a 1-5 scale.
Grade is 100%

SET grades:

So, for table 2, we see history has a correlation of 0.16 (and a p value of 0.01)
between SET and grade.
As SET goes from grade 1 to 5, the lowest grade I set to x
and the highest grade is x + (4 * 0.16) = x + 0.64.
Grades are, however, given as a percentage, i.e.
values from 1 to 100.
In this example, the difference between a bad and good teacher is
less than 1 percent point.





Open questions:

- Can SET be used when the team is only male?
- Can SET be corrected to be fair?

Imagine two learners, one with a bad one with a good teacher.
It is imaginable they get an equally good grade,
if the one with the bad teacher studies by him/herself
longer. It is imaginable that this student rates his/her
bad teacher lower.

Who understood the statistics of this paper?
