## Notes by Richel

- What grade on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) would you give this paper?

8

- How would you praise the paper?

It is a proper review with helpful tables.

- How would you criticise the paper?

The method the literature was searched was unspecified.
10 out of ~70 references had the last author among the authors.

- How would you summarize the paper in one line?

Co-teaching has effects, mostly positive, but more research is needed.

- How would this paper make us a better teacher?
  (putting in bigger context, as recommended by `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`)

It encourages us to try it out.

At first glance, co-teaching seems very exciting.
I feel that doing so makes both teachers better,
similar to pair programming.

The more interesting question is: 'Is it worth it?'.
Is it worth it to have twice as many teachers (hence, twice
the financial costs)?

This is a review paper. It is hard to criticise a review paper.
Exceptions are:

- Searching only part of the literature
- Citing papers incorrectly

Table 2 with the recommendations is useful: I've already used it :-)

Interesting:

> The impact of co-teaching on student evaluations has not been explored,
> even though instructor and course ratings may impact reward
> decisions (e.g., merit raises, promotion, tenure).

How to decide if co-teaching is worth it?
It takes twice as much people teaching and more than twice the time to prepare.
However, we do know that the two best ways to grow as a teacher is from
peer observation and writing reflections. I feel co-teaching is like
mutual peer observation. It forces one to work togethers, where this is
especially rare with course material.


10 of the ~100 papers are by Andrews, the last author.

`[Kursch & Veteska]` and `[Stark, 2015]` mentions some disadvantages.

`[Spörer et al., 2021]` is all positive here, although the title
of the paper suggests otherwise.

Paper                    |Number of citations
-------------------------|-------------------
`[Haag et al., 2023]`    |19
`[Barron & Friend, 2024]`|2
`[Nápoles, 2024]`        |4

A more recent review has been written `[Vembye et al., 2024]`,
however, it was about determining the effect size
of co-teaching, which is estimated to be 0.11.

Other recent reviews are:

- `[Barron & Friend, 2024]`:
- `[Nápoles, 2024]`:

A review on how to learn to co-teach is `[Rytivaara et al., 2024]`.
