    ?

## My questions

- Equity: equal opportunities, e.g. providing hearing aids for the deaf.

## Extent of the problem

I hope this paper will show how big the problem is that is solved.



The paper seems ambitious by also stating that it looks for
evidence.

## How do the listed DEI interventions improve DEI?

???- question "What are these 4 DEI interventions?"

    - Light touch DEI intervention
    - DEI training: workshops
    - DEI unit
    - DEI semester-long theme

Here is my initial guess:

Intervention                |Effect of diversity?|Effect on equity?|Effect on inclusion?
----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------
Light touch DEI intervention|?No                 |?No              |?Yes, but weird
DEI training: workshops     |?No                 |?No              |?No
DEI unit                    |?No                 |?No              |?No
DEI semester-long theme     |?No                 |?No              |?No

## 4. Outcomes


- A. Reduce implicit bias
- B. Increase participants’ awareness of their own biases/the impact of bias on others
- C. Teach participants strategies to overcome bias
- D. Increase opportunities to practice strategies to overcome bias
- E. Increase internal or external motivation to reduce bias
- F. Increase physics identity/intent to pursue a physic major or career

I think F is most important for this paper. I hope to read a number
about this.



## 4.A Implicit bias

> A. Reduce implicit bias
> While some interventions have been shown to reduce participants’ implicit biases (as measured
> on the Implicit Association Test, for example), these changes do not lead to changes in either explicit bias
> or behavior. Thus, I do not recommend reduction of implicit bias as an outcome goal unless it is
> accompanied with other goals; perhaps not even then, as it is not clear that implicit bias is in fact a

I think this is a good idea, to not care about implicit bias tests:
out of curiosity, I've taken one. This is my result:

> You were slightly faster at sorting 'Fat people' with 'Bad words' 
> and 'Thin people' with 'Good words' 
> than 'Thin people' with 'Bad words' and 'Fat people' with 'Good words'

This results does not give me any info. I felt the test was rigged.

## 4.F. Increase physics identity/intent to pursue a physic major or career

The paper refers to `[Hazari et al., 2013][42]`:

- (i) having a single-sex physics class
- (ii) having female scientist guest speakers, 
- (iii) having a female physics teacher, 
- (iv) discussing the work of female scientists
- (v) discussing the underrepresentation of women

Six point scale ('0 - Not at all likely' to '5 - Extremely likely')


discussion of underrepresentation was highly significantly
correlated with interest in a career in physical science. Discussing the work of female scientists
trended very strongly towards significance (p=.05).

Here is table 1 from `[Hazari et al., 2013][42]`:

![Hazari et al., 2013 table 1](hazari_et_al_2013_table_1.png)

I decided to take a look at the results visually, following the
line of reasoning of the paper:

![Hazari et al., 2013 table 1 as a plot](hazari_et_al_2013_results_2.png)

I also wanted to see the improvements, similar to the paper,
using `(new - old) / old = (treatment - control) / control = `,
resulting in the same reported values:

![Improvements](hazari_et_al_2013_results_2_improvement.png)

However, one thing that was weird to me, is that they compare groups taken at
different points in time: the treatment group was measured after the
treatment, where the control group used was the one before the treatment.

I decided to compare with the control group after the treatment:

![Hazari et al., 2013 table 1 as a plot](hazari_et_al_2013_results_1.png)

Here I see no difference. Let's plot the differences:

![Improvements](hazari_et_al_2013_results_1_improvement.png)

I conclude that `[Hazari et al., 2013][42]` is misleading
and proves that there is no relevant effect.
