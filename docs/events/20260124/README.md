## Notes

### Questions


- Q: What grade on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)
  would you give this paper?

???- question "My answer"

    8

- Q: How would you praise the paper?

???- question "My answer"

    It feels like a friendly, honest, open, impartial review.

- Q: How would you criticise the paper?

???- question "My answer"

    Not all of the references have a mini-summary. If I would be
    suspicious/paranoid, I would investigate if there is some
    partiality there.

- Q: How would you summarizly so in intensive online environments, where instructors need to work to establish and maintain student engagement. Pedagogical approaches need to account for learner competencies, characteristics, and preferred learning approaches. This e the paper in one line?

???- question "My answer"

    How neurons behave and learn is a dynamic field

- Q: Should we do what is in the paper?

???- question "My answer"

    Enjoy the enthusiasm of its authors.

- Q: How does this paper make us a better teacher?

???- question "My answer"

    I find it hard to use these concepts to teaching.

    I do like the `A -> R`, after which `AX -> R` has no effect:
    I feel that I too wold ignore the additional/useless signal.

    I am unsure if we say something like this:
    When we first teach a way that works, it is
    useless to present another way that works
    *without extra information*. Else, on a
    neuronal level, no learning happens.


## Scribbles

Abbreviation|Full
------------|-----------------------
RPE         |Reward prediction error
VTA         |Ventral tegmental area

I enjoy that the TLC tries to find papers that give good evidence in
becoming a better teacher. At the start of reading this paper,
I wonder how this will help us become a better teacher.

I like how they add comments to the references!

### Study 4

Procedure                                              |Results
-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
`1`. Train `A -> R`                                    |VTA dopamine neurons give RPE
`2a`. Train `AX -> R`                                  |'Blocking': `X` does not change the behavior of the neuron
`2b`. Train `AX -> R` and stimulate neurons to give RPE|`A -> R` is unlearnt. Conclude: RPE signal updates learning system

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

In my words: if a neuron has an association, additional info is ignored,
unless the neurons are artificially stimulated
to 'chemically pretend' to be learning.

### Study 5

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --><!-- Tables cannot be split up over lines, hence will break 80 characters per line -->

Procedure                                      |Results
-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------
`1`. Train `A -> R`                            |VTA dopamine neurons give RPE
`2`. Train `AX -> R`                           |'Blocking': `X` does not change the behavior of the neuron
`3`. Train `AY -> R`                           |'Blocking': `Y` does not change the behavior of the neuron
`4`. inhibit neurons during `AX` (but not `AY`)|Learning about `X` and `Y` was equally blocked.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

In my words: if a neuron has an association, additional info is ignored.
This additional info does not give any extra chemical signal whatsoever.

From 10: 'if dopamine release is inhibited during a novel cue,
learning about that cue is impaired'

'RPE signals are not
necessarily accurate representations of error, but reflect
an animal’s internal understanding of its environment
based on previous experiences in that environment'

Ramping: I would explain this is as:
When an interesting target becomes available,
a high RPE is given off, which decreases when the subject is
getting closes. The decrease in RPE is the chemical respresentation
of 'motivation'.


Rampls are 'a reduction in task dimensionality as
subjects narrow their focus to relevant stimuli'.

Ramps exist 'where internal goal
representations are necessary to support behavior'.
