# FAQ

## What is the goal of the teaching literature club?

Successful journal clubs have a long-term overarching
goal `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`.

The goal of this teaching literature club is,
by reading and discussing the literature on teaching,
to become a better teachers

## How do I know when meetings are?

The schedule above shows when the meetings are :-)

## How do I know which paper or book chapter will be discussed?

Papers will be scheduled ahead of time,
ideally at least one month in advance.

## Why is there no emaillist?

Because no need for it is felt yet.
You are encouraged to volunteer to maintain one :-)

## How does a meeting go?

When you show up at a meeting,
someone has prepared to discuss a paper or book chapter.
This paper or book chapter is announced on this site,
ideally at least one month in advance.

The person having picked the reading material determines freely:

- whether there is a presentation about the reading material
- how to lead a discussion on the reading material

## I am not part of NBIS. Am I welcome?

Yes.

## I want to attend and will be 5 minutes late. Am I welcome?

Yes.

There is a chance the literature club has been cancelled, if,
for example, there are zero attendees at the starting time.

## I want to attend without having read the paper. Am I welcome?

Yes.

## I want to attend without suggesting to read a paper. Am I welcome?

Yes.

## I want to discuss a paper or book chapter. How do I do so?

Great!

**First**, we need to know, so we can put you in the schedule and share
the reading materials one meeting in advance with the rest.

To let us know: create an Issue here or send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`.

**Second**, on the day you discuss a paper or book chapter,
you may determine freely:

- whether there is a presentation about the reading material
- how to lead a discussion on the reading material

The meeting will end sharply on time!

## I present a something and need to cancel at the last minute. What do I do?

Create an Issue here or send an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`.
Elin and Richel will always have a paper to be discussed ready.

## Why online-only?

NBIS is a national organisation throughout Sweden,
hence online is the norm.

## Why not hybrid?

We felt it was reasonable to start online-only first.
Hybrid meetings are more complex,
but we can imagine we go hybrid one day,
when groups in different cities start gathering.

## Why not meet in real life?

NBIS is a national organisation throughout Sweden,
so meeting in real life (in any one place) would exclude most of NBIS.

## Why monthly?

A successful journal club meets at
regular and predictable intervals `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`.

For this club, we felt that monthly is a reasonable starting frequency.
If the schedule starts overflowing,
we will consider doing this every two weeks.

## Who is/are the organizers?

Within an effective journal club it is clear who
(singular or plural) leads it `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`.

Currently, Richel is chairman and Elin is vice chairman.

## Why not organise this differently?

Because this is the current plan.

There are points we feel we can deviate from the literature:

- In this club, attendance is not expected and not recorded and not mandatory
  (instead of the advice to have attendance expected and/or recorded
  and/or mandatory `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`).
  We feel this does not fit the NBIS life of flexible schedule

You can share your feedback at this repository by:

- creating an [Issue](https://github.com/NBISweden/teaching_literature_club/issues):
  this results in a public discussion and require a GitHub account
- sending an email to `richel.bilderbeek@icm.uu.se`
- share your feedback in the next round:
  a round of collection of feedback is planned in November,
  i.e. after the third meeting.
  These results will probably be shared in December,
  i.e. during the fourth meeting.

## Why is the name so clumsy?

For two reasons:

- is uses only simple words, hence no 'pedagogy' in the name
- at least one of the organizers thinks
  it is funny to have such a clumsy name,
  as it is unclear if it is a club to
  read the pedagogy literature or that it
  teaches literature.

## What is the number of visitors per event?

The number of visitors per event can be found
at [the 'Data' page](data.md).
