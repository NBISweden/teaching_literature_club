# How to run a literature club

A review of of the literature :-)

- [x] members should be of the same discipline `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`

## Leading journal club

- 'Train the leader/facilitator of the journal club in relevant
  research design and/or statistical knowledge so as to appropriately
  direct group discussions and assist the group to work towards its
  goals' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
- 'The leader can change from meeting to meeting, however they
  needs to have the skills to present the paper under discussion and
  lead the group adequately. It is a fine balance between choosing a
  leader of high academic standing whose expertise may stifle discussion,
  or choosing a leader from peers who may not have the
  requisite understanding of the paper under discussion' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
- 'Provide access to a statistician to assist the leader in preparing
  for journal club, and to answer questions that may arise from the
  journal club discussion' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`

## Choosing articles for discussion

- 'Choose relevant case-based or clinical articles for discussion.
  These papers should be of interest to all participants. Articles
  should be chosen in line with the overarching purpose of the
  journal club' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
- 'Identify one journal club member (either the designated leader
  or a member) who has the responsibility for identifying the literature
  to be discussed for each meeting. This person should also lead
  the discussion on the article at the journal club' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`

## Circulating articles for discussion

- 'Provide all participants for each journal club (in addition to the
  leader) with pre-reading at a suitable time period prior to the
  journal club (may be up to a week prior). Participants should agree
  to the time frame for pre-reading. In some curriculum-based
  situations, assessment of whether pre-reading has occurred may be
  appropriate' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
- 'Use the internet as a means of distributing articles prior to the
  meeting, maintaining journal club resources and optimizing use of
  time and resources' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`

## Efficiently running the journal club

- 'Use established critical appraisal approaches and structured
  worksheets during the journal club session, which leads to healthy
  and productive discussion' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
- 'Formally conclude each journal club by putting the article in
  context of clinical practice' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`

## Journal club effectiveness

- 'Depending on the journal club purpose, it may be appropriate to
  evaluate knowledge uptake formally or informally' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
- 'Evaluation should specifically relate to the article(s) for
  discussion, critical appraisal, understanding of biostatistics reported in
  the paper and translating evidence into practice' `[Deenadayalan et al., 2008]`
