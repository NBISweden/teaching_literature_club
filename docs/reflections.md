# Reflections

## 2024-11-28 by Rich√®l

After three TLCs, I am quite happy.
Below is why, followed by future plans

### The scheduling has adapted to reflect our group size

The first TLC was scheduled from a Doodle
and nobody was there.
To fix this, me and two people that were interested
picked a date.
Since then, in the last 5 minutes, we schedule our next meeting
altogether. As we are a small group, this works perfect.

### Everyone involved

I pay attention that everyone gets to talk.
Maybe this is too disruptive at times,
but when asking for feedback, people
tell me it is fine.

### Enjoyable conversations

As far as I see, the conversations are enjoyable.
I feel that there is nobody being dominant in our
meetings (except for me, that want everyone to speak his/her
mind, but that is not someone dominating a discussion).
I feel lucky with our current participants who
seem to care about a healthy conversation too.

### Future plans

Keep going as it is: it seems to go fine.
Reflect again before summer.
