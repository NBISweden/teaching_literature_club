## Notes by Richel


### My questions

- Do we all know a teacher that uses seductive details?
- Do we really believe that they came up with their model and hypotheses
  first, after which all was confirmed to be true?
- How would you summarize the paper?

### My scribbles

First sentence:

> Instructors often rely on seductive details, such as jokes, stories,
> and video clips, to keep trainees entertained

Is this the case? How often? Is this to entertain the trainees or
is it a way of teachers to enjoy teaching more?


From

only humor is directly related to this paper, with an effect size of 0.04,
which is low.

Main findings: Seductive details ...

- indirectly improved learning performance by reducing negative affect
- indirectly hindered learning performance by increasing the speed of reviewing
- indirectly hindered learning performance by decreasing time on task.

First sentence in the introduction:

> Trainers and educators are typically evaluated based on whether
> trainees enjoy their courses and feel the course is useful

I think that asking a student for satisfaction is an uninteresting
metric. So this paper assumes that teachers use seductive details
to improve a half-useless metric?

> [...] including irrelevant information in training
> makes learning more engaging, but impairs retention,
> problem solving, and training transfer [many refs]
> Seductive details have garnered interest from researchers in
> education and psychology because of the counterintuitiveness of the effect.

Why is this counterintuitive? When I spend less time on problem solving
(e.g. because I tell a fun anecdote),
I expect the learners to be worse on problem solving.
What is counterintuitive in that?


> In education, affect is broadly defined as the attitudes, emotions,
> and values present in an educational environment

Do we really believe that they came up with their model and hypotheses
first, after which all was confirmed to be true? For example,
the model assumes a reduction in negative affect. Why not use 'affect'
instead of 'negative affect'? If 'negative affect' is used,
why not add 'positive affect?'

Interesting!

I could argue the other way around too: seductive details
cause trainees to page through the content **slower**, because
they look for those fun distractions.

What does this mean, how can a Cronbach's alpha
differ per module for the same question?

Does it? What about governmental financial support, status of the
teacher, tendency of politicians to do another education
reform? The suggestion that using student opinions to judge
good teaching is the cause of a decline in learning does
not speak for itself to me.

So no 'satisfaction' on evaluations :-)

My summary:

The paper investigates the effect of seductive details.
It has a small negative effect on some outcomes.
