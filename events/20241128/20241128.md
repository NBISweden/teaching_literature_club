## Notes by Richel

- Do we all know a teacher that uses seductive details?

### My questions

- ...

### My scribbles

First sentence:

> Instructors often rely on seductive details, such as jokes, stories,
> and video clips, to keep trainees entertained

Is this the case? How often? Is this to entertain the trainees or
is it a way of teachers to enjoy teaching more?


From [the Visible Learning table](https://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/),
only humor is directly related to this paper, with an effect size of 0.04,
which is low.

Main findings: Seductive details ...

- indirectly improved learning per-formance by reducing negative affect
- indirectly hindered learning performance by increasing the speed of reviewing
- indirectly hindered learning performance by decreasing time on task.

First sentence in the introduction:

> Trainers and educators are typically evaluated based on whether
> trainees enjoy their courses and feel the course is useful

I think that asking a student for satisfaction is an uninteresting
metric. So this paper assumes that teachers use seductive details
to improve a half-useless metric? 

> [...] including irrelevant information in training
> makes learning more engaging, but impairs retention,
> problem solving, and training transfer [many refs]
> Seductive details have garnered interest from researchers in
> education and psychology because of the counterintuitiveness of the effect.

Why is this counterintuitive? When I spend less time on problem solving
(e.g. because I tell a fun anecdote),
I expect the learners to be worse on problem solving.
What is counterintuitive in that?
