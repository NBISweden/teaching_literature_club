The relationship is small, not universal, and subject to the following inter- vening variables:</p> <ol> <li>The association is stronger in research published in    educational journals than in other sources.</li> <li>The association is strongest in studies from the    education and liberal arts disciplines. There is no    evidence that the association exists in business classes.</li> <li>The type of learning measures made a difference.    The more objective the measures, the smaller the    learning/SET association.</li> <li>The more statistical control was utilized to handle    extraneous variables in both learning and SET, the    less association was found. The attenuation of this    relationship when age of publication was added as a    covariant suggests simply that researchers are    becoming increasingly sophisticated over time in    their utilization of statistical control.</li> <li>The findings are highly variable, even for the same    researcher.

Sullivan and Skanes\u2019 (1974) find-    ings ranged from \u2212.28 to .55.</li> <li>There is no evidence in this sample that a learning/    SET association exists in within-class data.</li> </ol> <p>Here is meta-analysis <code>[Uttl et al., 2017]</code>, that came out after the paper:</p> <ul> <li>Students do not learn more from professors with higher   student evaluation of teaching (SET) ratings.</li> <li>Previus [sic] meta-analyses of SET/learning correlations   in multisection studies are not interprettable.</li> <li>Re-analyses of previous meta-analyses of multisection studies   indicate that SET ratings explain at most 1% of variability   in measures of student learning.</li> <li>New meta-analyses of multisection studies show that SET ratings   are unrelated to student learning.</li> </ul> <p>Also from <code>[Uttl et al., 2017]</code>:</p> <p>[..] indicate presence of strong small study size effects. The small sized studies often reported impossibly high voodoo SET/learning correlations whereas the large sized studies reported small or no correlations.</p> <p>And:</p> <p>[...] when the analyses include both multisection studies with and without prior learning/ability controls, the estimated SET/learning corre- lations are very weak with SET ratings accounting for up to 1% of variance in learning/achievement measures.</p> <p>And</p> <p>The entire notion that we could measure professors' teaching effectiveness by simple ways such as asking students to answer a few questions [...] seems unrealistic given well established \ufb01ndings from cognitive sciences</p> <p>And:</p> <p>a professor is faced with a stark dilemma: teach to the SET and be promoted and tenured, or teach to prepare students for the next course, graduation and future careers, and be terminated.</p> <p>These are comments below the paper:</p> <p>Emil Ole William Kirkegaard wrote:</p> <p>I have some comments:</p> <ul> <li>Use confidence intervals, not p values (cf. 'New Statistics').   These can be obtained by bootstrapping.   If you really want p values, then report both.</li> <li>Put the effect sizes with confidence intervals in the abstract.</li> <li>Alter the empahsis to be more about the lack of correlation between SET and   teacher ability. The focus on gender bias is not warranted with the small   effect. It is clearly not \"large\" as claimed. mean r = 0.09 \u2248 d 0.20,   which by Cohen's standards is small. There is too much social justice   warrior about this article.</li> <li>It is possible to adjust for the gender bias by simply adding a little to   the females SET multiplied by the proportion of male students.</li> <li>Note which gender was the biased one in the abstract (male against   females, not female against males, cf. Table 5).</li> <li>A simpler recommendation is that SETs should not be used at all since they   apparently do not correlate with actual performance. Why have them?   This side-steps the entire gender bias issue.</li> <li>Add to the abstract that the gender effect could not be explained by male   instructors being better (i.e. findings from Table 4).</li> <li>The technical aspect of the analyses seemed fine to me.</li> </ul> <p>Hope these comments are useful. Overall, I liked the article.</p> <p>From a review by Jason Barr:</p> <p>So, in the French study we do not know exactly what aspect of teaching effectiveness is being correlated with instructor gender. In the U.S. study, we know that overall teaching quality is NOT associated with instructor gender.</p> <p>And:</p> <p>In studies of ratings of actual teachers there is only a very weak relationship that favors female instructors (Centra, 2009; Feldman, 1993)</p> <p>And:</p> <p>this study shows gender contributes only about 1% of the variance in student ratings Hardly a \u201clarge and statistically significant\u201d amount as stated by the authors.</p> <p>Note the short reply by the authors:</p> <p>We look forward to additional reviews by people who do not have a financial interest in SET.</p> <p>This is funny, as Boring lists 'Gender economics' on her site and Stark mentions 'gender bias' on his site. They too have a financial interest in finding gender biases :-)</p> <p>From a review by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel:</p> <p>Discussion of effect size and practical significance</p> <p>The article does not discuss effect sizes and considerations around practical significance. This is especially important for the French dataset which has a large number of observations. Indeed in Section 6 the authors discuss the importance of finding small p-values with the small US dataset, however a similar discussion is not included for the French dataset.</p>","tags":["notes","\u00c5sa","Andr\u00e9s Garz\u00f3n","Boring","Ottoboni"]},{"location":"events/20250116/#notes-from-meeting","title":"Notes from meeting","text":"<ul> <li>Maybe in natural subjects, the correlation is stronger.</li> </ul>","tags":["notes","\u00c5sa","Andr\u00e9s Garz\u00f3n","Boring","Ottoboni"]},{"location":"events/20250116/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li><code>[Boring &amp; Ottoboni, 2016]</code>   Boring, Anne, and Kellie Ottoboni.   \"Student evaluations of teaching (mostly)   do not measure teaching effectiveness.\" ScienceOpen research (2016).</li> <li><code>[Clayson, 2009]</code>   Clayson, Dennis E. \"Student evaluations of teaching: Are they related to   what students learn?
